All notable changes to the "Tasks Launcher" extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.3] - 2025-08-25

### Enhanced
- **Smart Menu Display**: Menu options now show file availability status
- **File Existence Validation**: Real-time checking of package.json and .vscode/tasks.json files
- **Improved User Experience**: Clear indication when required files are missing
- **Preventive Execution**: Menu items for missing files show descriptive messages but don't execute

### Fixed
- **Menu Item Behavior**: Clicking on configuration options when files don't exist no longer attempts execution
- **Status Bar Text**: Updated from "Run Scripts" to "Run Tasks" for consistency

### Refactor
- **Interface Cleanup**: Removed unused `TaskItem` interface
- **Code Organization**: Improved interface naming consistency (`NpmTaskItem` ‚Üî `VSCodeTaskItem`)
- **Terminology Normalization**: Standardized "scripts" to "tasks" throughout codebase and documentation

### Technical Improvements
- **File Detection Logic**: Enhanced menu generation with real-time file existence checks
- **Error Prevention**: Added validation before command execution to prevent unnecessary operations
- **Interface Optimization**: Streamlined TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

## [1.0.2] - 2025-08-24

### Added
- **VSCode Tasks Support**: Full integration with `.vscode/tasks.json` tasks
- **Dual Task Management**: Support for both npm scripts and VSCode tasks in a single interface
- **Visual Task Differentiation**: Different icons for npm scripts (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) and VSCode tasks (üîß)
- **Separate Selection Interfaces**: Independent configuration for npm scripts and VSCode tasks
- **VSCode Task API Integration**: Native execution using VSCode's task system

### Enhanced
- **Menu System**: Combined dropdown showing both npm scripts and VSCode tasks with clear visual distinction
- **Task Naming**: Intelligent task name resolution for tasks without explicit labels
- **Configuration**: Added `selectedVSCodeTasks` setting for VSCode task selection
- **Commands**: Added `selectVSCodeTasks` and `runVSCodeTask` commands
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation for tasks.json files and task definitions

### Commands Added
- `scriptsLauncher.selectVSCodeTasks`: Select VSCode tasks from tasks.json
- `scriptsLauncher.runVSCodeTask`: Execute VSCode tasks using native API

### Configuration Added

### Fixed
- **JSONC Support**: Fixed parsing errors when tasks.json contains comments (// or /* */)
- **Task File Compatibility**: Full support for VSCode's default tasks.json format with comments

### Technical Improvements
- **Task Resolution**: Smart task name generation for npm tasks without labels
- **File Detection**: Automatic detection of `.vscode/tasks.json` files
- **Task Parsing**: Robust parsing of various task types (npm, shell, etc.)
- **JSON Comments Support**: Proper handling of JSONC format with comments in tasks.json files
- **API Integration**: Proper use of VSCode Task API for task execution
- **Type Safety**: Extended TypeScript interfaces for VSCode task support
